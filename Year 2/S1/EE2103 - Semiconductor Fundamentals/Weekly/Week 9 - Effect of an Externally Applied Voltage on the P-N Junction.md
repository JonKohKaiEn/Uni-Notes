# P-N Junction Under Applied Bias
- Forward bias
	- Positive bias to p-type side, negative bias to n-type side
	- Holes and electrons are pushed towards the middle, so $x_p$ and $x_n$ change
		- Space charge region becomes smaller
	- Applied electric field, $\xi_a$ is opposite in direction to $\xi_{bi}$
		- $\xi = \xi_0 - \xi_a$
	- Fermi level is split into $E_{Fp}$ and $E_{Fn}$
		- $E_{Fp}$ moves down, $E_{Fn}$ moves up
	- $V_{bi}$ will decrease, allowing more carriers to diffuse
- Negative bias
	- Negative bias to p-type side, positive bias to p-type side
	- Holes and electrons are pulled to the edges
		- Space charge level becomes bigger
	- $\xi_a$ is in the same direction as $\xi_{bi}$
		- $\xi = \xi_0 + \xi_a$
	- Fermi level splits
		- $E_{Fp}$ moves up, $E_{Fn}$ moves down
	- $V_{bi}$ will increase, so less carriers can diffuse
-  Space charge width becomes: $\huge W = \left[\frac{2\epsilon_r\epsilon_0(V_{bi} - V_a)}{q}\left(\frac{N_A+N_D}{N_A N_D}\right)\right]^{\frac{1}{2}}$
# Minority Carrier Distribution Under Applied Bias
- Definitions
	- $n_{p0}$ : concentration of minority carriers (electrons) in p-type at thermal equilibrium
	- $n_p$ : concentration of minority carriers (electrons) in p-type under bias
	- $p_{n0}$ : concentration of minority carriers (holes) in n-type at thermal equilibrium
	- $p_n$ : concentration of minority carriers (holes) in n-type under bias
- For forward bias, minority carriers are injected
- For reverse bias, minority carriers are extracted
