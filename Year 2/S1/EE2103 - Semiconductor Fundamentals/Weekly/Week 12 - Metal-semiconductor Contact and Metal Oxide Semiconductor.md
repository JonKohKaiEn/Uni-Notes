# Metal-semiconductor contact
- Schottky contact
	- Behaves like p-n junction
		- Carriers flow into only one side
	- Space charge width
		- When a metal comes into contact with a semiconductor, electrons can easily flow into the metal
		- Since there is a net flow towards the metal, a space charge region (depletion region) is formed
		- Since $N_a >> N_d$ , $W = \left[\frac{2\epsilon V_o}{q} \left(\frac{1}{N_d}\right) \right]^\frac{1}{2}$
	- External bias
		- Behaves similar to p-n junction
		- Schottky diode is a majority carrier device (p-n diode is minority carrier device)
		- Can still use $I = I_0\left(exp\left[\frac{qV}{kT}\right]-1\right)$
- Ohmic contact
	- Behaves like a normal wire
		- Carriers flow both ways
	- Almost no barrier (space charge region does not form)
- Field Effect Transistor
	- 3 parts
		- Source: Supplies carriers
		- Drain: Collects carriers
		- Gate: Controls carrier flow
	- n-channel FET
		- Channel carriers are electrons
		- Drain voltage w.r.t source ($V_{DS}$) is positive
		- Electrons flow from source to drain
			- Direction of current is from drain to source
	- p-channel FET
		- Channel carriers are holes
		- Drain voltage w.r.t source ($V_{DS}$) is negative
		- Holes flow from source to drain
			- Direction of current is from source to drain
			- By convention, current ($I_D$) is defined as positive going from drain to source, so current is negative for p-channel FET
# Metal Oxide Semiconductor
- Accumulation ($V_G < 0$)
	- Negative voltage applied on metal side
	- Holes accumulate at interface region -> interface region becomes more p-type than bulk region
	- Band is bent upwards from bulk to interface
- Depletion ($V_G > 0$)
	- Positive voltage applied on metal side
	- Holes are depleted from the interface -> interface becomes less p-type than bulk region
	- Band is bent downwards from bulk to interface
- Inversion ($V_G >> 0$)
	- More holes are removed from interface
	- More band bending occurs
	- Intrinsic Fermi level at the surface is below the Fermi level
	- Surface is inverted from p-type to n-type
- MOSFET
	- Enhancement mode: Channel not present, apply voltage to create channel
	- Depletion mode: Channel present, apply voltage to remove channel
