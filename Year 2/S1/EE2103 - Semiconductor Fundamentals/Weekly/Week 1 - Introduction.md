- Electrons around an atom occupy energy levels
	- Nearer to the nucleus -> Lower Energy
	- Further from the nucleus -> Higher Energy
- When a large number of atoms are placed together, energy bands can be formed
	- $E_v$ : Valence Band
	- $E_c$ : Conduction Band
	- $E_g$ : Energy Band Gap
- What we can learn from band structure
	- Steepness of the curvature tells us about the effective mass of the electron
		- Effective mass is inversely proportional to the curvature of E-k graph
	- Can tell us if it is a direct or indirect band gap
		- If the maxima of the valence band is aligned (similar k value) to the minima of the conduction band, then it is a direct band gap
		- If it is direct band gap, electrons in $E_c$ do not have to lose much energy before being able to drop to $E_v$
