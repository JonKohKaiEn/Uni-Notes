# Ideal Diode Current
- Total diode current density ($J$)
	- $J_n(-x_p) + J_p(x_n)$
# Bipolar Junction Transistor / Light Emitting Diode
- n-p-n
	- Forward active mode
		- Forward bias at emitter-base
		- Reverse bias at base-collector
		- Base width is narrow
			- Prevent recombination of electrons
		- Emitter is highly doped
			- Higher concentration of electrons
			- More electrons that can be emitted
- LED
	- Made using semiconductors with direct bandgap
	- In forward bias, carriers are injected, so light can be emitted via recombination
