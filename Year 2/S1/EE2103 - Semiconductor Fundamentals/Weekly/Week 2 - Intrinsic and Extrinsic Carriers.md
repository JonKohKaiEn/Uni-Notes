# Intrinsic & Extrinsic Carriers
- In order for an electron to move from $E_v$ to $E_c$ , it has to be removed from being a bonding electron
- How to move more electrons into $E_c$ ?
	- Increase temperature
		- At low temperatures, all electrons are below $E_v$ , so semiconductor acts as insulator
		- At higher temperatures, some electrons can jump to $E_c$ , so semiconductor can act as conductor
	- Incident light (use $E_g = \dfrac{hc}{\lambda}$ to calculate minimum wavelength required)
	- Doping
		- N-type doping
			- Introducing elements with more valence electrons (generally Group V)
			- Extra electrons are not used in bonding, so they are easier to move to $E_c$ 
			- Can be represented on the energy band diagram by drawing a line just under $E_c$ 
				- Distance to $E_c$ is smaller, so the electrons require less energy to jump to $E_c$ 
		- P-type doping
			- Introducing elements with lesser valence electrons (generally Group III)
			- Can be described as "holes" moving around as charge carriers
			- Can be represented on the energy band diagram by drawing a line just above $E_v$
				- Electron from $E_v$ can easily jump to the empty energy level, leaving a hole at $E_v$
		- Binding energy of electron
			- $E_n = -\dfrac{q^4}{2(4\pi\hbar)^2}\left(\dfrac{m_0}{\epsilon_r^2\epsilon_0^2}\right)\dfrac{1}{n^2}$ 
			- Can be estimated by hydrogen atom, where $E_n = -\dfrac{13.6}{n^2}eV$

# Temperature Dependence
- We can use $\dfrac{n}{N_D}$ to describe the effects of temperature
	- $n$ : Number of electrons in conduction band
	- $N_D$ : Number of dopant atoms
- 3 temperature phases of a doped semiconductor
	- Freeze out
		- $n < N_D \implies \dfrac{n}{N_D}<1$
		- Not all of the dopant electrons have been ionized
		- $n$ increases as temperature increases
	- Extrinsic T-region
		- $n = N_D \implies \dfrac{n}{N_D}=1$
		- All of the dopant electrons have been ionized
		- $n$ does not increase as temperature increases
	- Intrinsic T-region
		- $n > N_D \implies \dfrac{n}{N_D}>1$
		- Electrons from the intrinsic material start to be ionized
		- n increases as temperature increases
- When the semiconductor is in "Freeze out" or "Intrinsic T-region", the carrier density is uncontrollable -> conductivity can change -> behaviour can become unpredictable
