## What is the band gap?
The band gap is the minimum energy required to excite an electron from valence band to the conduction band

## How does the band gap affect the properties of a semiconductor?
#### Conductivity
- A semiconductor with a smaller band gap needs lesser energy to become conductive
- Conversely, a semiconductor with a larger band gap needs more energy to become conductive

#### Optical Properties
- The band gap of a semiconductor can affect how it interacts with photons
- Optical properties include absorption and emission

#### Thermal Properties
- The conductivity of a semiconductor is dependent on the size of the band gap
- A larger band gap means that the semiconductor will require more energy to become conductive

## What affects the band gap?
The band gap of a semiconductor is only affected by its chemical composition.

### Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic
#### Intrinsic
- Pure crystal with no impurity or defects
- $n_i$ = Number of electrons in conduction band = Number of holes in valence band
- $n_i$ increases with increasing temperature
#### Extrinsic


### Direct vs. Indirect
