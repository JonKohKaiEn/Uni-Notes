# Snow
## What is snow?
- Mixture of ice and air (and also water at temperatures > 0°C)
	- 2-phase material (3-phase if water is involved)
- Grains or crystals
- Bonds between grains
## Snow as a material
- Properties can change due to many different factors
	- Porosity
	- Proximity to melting point
	- Degree of sintering (forming a solid mass of material by pressure or heat without melting it)
	- Humidity
	- Liquid water content
	- Grain size & structure
	- Compaction and settlement
## Formation of snow
- Presence of a cloud capable of producing precipitation
	- Warm moist air is forced upwards to colder layers of the atmosphere
		- Forced up by warm/cold front
		- Heated by a relatively warm water surface (Lake-effect snow)
		- Air encounters an obstacle
	- Water vapour requires a nucleation site (soot, dust, etc.) to condense
- Temperature near the ground must be below or just a few degrees above 0°C
- Snow crystals can form through 2 ways
	- Sublimation/Deposition
		- Water vapour freezes directly on nucleation sites
	- Freezing
		- Saturated water droplets freeze upon contact with ice crystals
	- Dew point and frost point
		- Dew point is the temperature at which the air is saturated with water vapour
			- If the air is further cooled, water droplets start to condense
		- Frost point is the same as dew point but when the temperature is less than 0°C
- Once snow crystals form, they grow by absorbing surrounding water droplets
- Snow crystal shape
	- The structure of water molecules makes it such that snow crystals are hexagonal
	- The crystal shape is temperature dependent
## Winter precipitation types
- Snow
	- No melting occurs
	- Temperature is below 0°C all the way down
- Sleet
	- Snow (partially) melts and refreezes before touching the ground
- Freezing rain
	- Snow melts completely
	- Rain drops become supercooled in cold air
	- Refreezes on contact with the ground
- Rain
	- Snow melts completely
	- Does not refreeze
## Machine-made snow
- Main uses
	- Constructions
	- Buildings
	- Base of ski slopes
- Properties
	- Higher density
	- Round grains
	- Close-packed structure
	- Ice content in snow may be higher
	- Higher effective area
	- Resists warm weather better
## Basic structural characteristics
- Density
	- Affects many other physical and mechanical properties
- Snow structure
	- Size and shape of the grains
	- Specific Surface Area (SSA): $\frac{surface \ area \ [m^2]}{volume \ [m^3]}$
		- Grains with large SSA (small rounded grains) grow bonds faster than large grains
- Snow hardness
	- Hand hardness test
	- Penetrometer
- Snow wetness
	- Liquid Water Content (LWC): $\frac{water \ volume \ [m^3]}{total \ volume \ [m^3]} \%$
- Thermal conductivity
	- How much heat passes through 1 meter of material at a temperature difference of 1°C
	- Higher ice content -> Higher density -> higher thermal conductivity
	- Temperature, microstructure, and other properties can also affect thermal conductivity
# Metamorphism
## Destructive (Isothermal)
- Occurs faster at higher temperatures
## Constructive (temperature-gradient)
- Snow crystals grow and form prisms, columns or pyramid like shapes
- Temperature gradient needed
	- Larger temperature gradient -> faster metamorphism
## Melt-freeze (wet-snow)
- Occurs when temperatures are above freezing by day and below freezing at night
- Above freezing, frozen water between the grains melts, weakening bonds
- Below freezing, snowpack refreezes and strengthens
