In time domain analysis, we apply a reference input signal to a system and evaluate the system's response in the time domain

For a stable system, the total time response $y(t) = y_{t}(t) + y_{ss}(t)$
- $y_{t}(t)$ : Transient Response
	- Should be as short as possible
- $y_{ss}(t)$ : Steady-state response
	- Follow the input signal as close as possible

| Name    | Function                             |
| ------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Impulse | $a\delta (t)$                        |
| Step    | $au(t)$                              |
| Ramp    | $at \quad \text{when} \quad t \ge 0$ |
