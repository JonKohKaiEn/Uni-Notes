In time domain analysis, we apply a reference input signal to a system and evaluate the system's response in the time domain

| Time Domain Analysis | Frequency Domain Analysis |
| -------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Impulse              | Sinusoidal                |
| Step                 |                           |
| Slope                |                           |
| Parabolic functions  |                           |
For a stable system, the total time response $y(t) = y_{}$
