# Tests
## Spectroscopic Methods
### Flame Photometry
- Metal ions dropped into a flame
- Electrons excited by the flame, then drops back down, releasing light of a certain wavelength
- Pros
	- Fast
	- Easy to do
	- Simple Equipment
- Cons
	- Requires large amounts of the sample
	- Destructive
	- Subject to interference
## Atomic Absorption Spectrometer (AAS)
- Detects the presence of a specific element
- Pros
	- Fast
	- Specific
	- Sensitive
	- Small sample size
- Cons
	- Destructive
	- Element by element (slow)
## Energy Dispersive X-Ray Fluorescence (EDX)
- Uses an electron beam to eject core electrons
- Electrons from higher shells fill vacancy, emitting X-rays
- Done together with Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM)
- Pros
	- Non-destructive
### Neutron Activation Analysis (NAA)
- Expose sample to beta radiation (neutrons)
- Nuclei can absorb neutrons, then decay, releasing gamma rays of a certain energy
- Pros
	- Non-destructive
- Cons
	- Requires nuclear reactor
	- Sample may be radioactive afterwards
