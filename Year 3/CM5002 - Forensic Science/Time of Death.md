# Algor Mortis
- Cooling of the body
- Different parts cool at different rates
	- e.g. Brain cools faster than the liver
- General rate: 1-1.5°F (0.6-0.8°C)
# Rigor Mortis
| Body Part  | Time (Hours) |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| Jaw        | 2            |
| Arms       | 4-6          |
| Legs       | 8-10         |
| Whole body | 10-12        |
# Livor Mortis
- Settling of blood due to gravity
# Putrefaction
- Microorganisms start to eat a body after death
- Rate heavily depends on environmental factors and drug use

| Time (day)   | Observation                                                        |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 2-3          | Staining of the abdomen, swelling of the body due to gas formation |
| 3-4          | Staining spreads, veins become discoloured                         |
| 5-6          | Abdomen swells, skin blisters                                      |
| 14 (2 weeks) | Abdomen very tight and swollen                                     |
| 21 (3 weeks) | Tissue softens, organs and cavities bursting, nails fall off       |
| 28 (4 weeks) | Soft tissues liquefy, face becoming unrecognisable                 |
# Forensic Entomology
- Observing the insects present on the body
- Determining life stage of the insects
# FUN Analysis
- Determine levels of Fluorine, Uranium, Nitrogen in bone
- Nitrogen decreases with age (due to protein breakdown)
- Fluorine and Uranium increases with age (from ground water)
# Carbon-14 Dating
- Determine level of Carbon-14 in sample
- Not accurate for <400 years
# Miscellaneous
- Potassium ions in ocular fluid
	- Increases after death
- Stomach and intestine contents
	- Stomach empties in about 2 hours
- Mobile phone records
