# Chromatography
Different compounds move at different speeds through an absorbent
## Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC)
- Uses absorbent layer (usually silica)
## Gas Chromatography
- Uses a carrier gas
- Can determine amount of a compound
	- Area under the peak proportional to amount of the compound
- Pros
	- Simple and inexpensive equipment
	- Fast
## High Performance Liquid Chromatography
- Similar to gas chromatography, but using liquid mobile phase
- Can determine amount of a compound
	- Area under the peak proportional to amount of the compound
- Pros
	- Can accommodate non-volatile and thermally unstable samples
# Infrared Spectroscopy
- Relies on the stretching and bending of chemical bonds
- Different bonds oscillate by different amounts
- Fingerprint region: <1500 cm-1
# Mass Spectrometry
- Differentiates compounds based on mass
	- Heavier compounds deflect less in a magnetic field
- Compounds can fragment in the spectrometer
- Can be combined with gas chromatography (GC-MS)
