# Introduction
## Structure of DNA
### Chromosomes
- Nuclear DNA is packaged in chromosomes
- Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes
	- Autosomal (non-sex): 22 pairs
	- Sex determining: 2 pairs
### Genes
- DNA material have 'coding' and 'non-coding' regions
	- Non-coding regions take up approximately 95% of the gene
### Composition
- Nucleotide
	- A sugar
	- A phosphate
	- A base
		- Adenine
		- Guanine
		- Cytosine
		- Thymine
## Genetic Code
- A group of three nucleotides codes for an amino acid in a protein
# DNA Fingerprinting
Mainly uses the junk DNA for matching
