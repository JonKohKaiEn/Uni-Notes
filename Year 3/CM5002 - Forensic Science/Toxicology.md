# Measuring Toxicity
- LD50
	- Amount to kill half of a given population of test animals
- Depends on many factors
	- Size
	- Age
	- State of health
	- History
	- Paradoxical Reactions
# Alcohol
- Main effect is depression of central nervous system
- Absorbed by the stomach (20%) and small intestine (80%)
- Eliminated mainly through the liver, kidneys and lungs
# Inorganic Poisons
- Arsenic Trioxide
	- Marsh test can be used, but now we use [[Spectroscopy and Structure of Atoms#Atomic Absorption Spectrometer (AAS)|AAS]]
- Thallium
	- Interferes with nervous system due to similarity with Potassium
- Barium
	- Barium Sulfate is given to patients to take X-Rays of the digestive system
		- Insoluble, so cannot be absorbed
	- Barium Acetate can be used as poison
- Sarin Gas
	- Nerve agent
		- Causes an excess of neurotransmitters
- Atrophine
	- Antidote to Sarin, but can also be used as a poison
