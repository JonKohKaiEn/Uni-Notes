# Input and Output Offset Voltages
## Input Offset Voltage
- $V_{IO}$ is the negative of the DC voltage that must be applied between the inputs of a non-ideal op-amp to force $v_0$ to zero under open-loop conditions
- Typically between 10mv and 1uV
- May also vary with temperature
- Represented by a voltage source placed at the non-inverting input

### How to find $V_{IO}$
- Find difference between expected $v_o$ and actual $v_o$
- Divide by $A_{vCL}$ to get $V_{IO}$
## Output Offset Voltage
- $V_{IO} \times A_{vOL}$
# Input Bias and Input Offset Current
- Non-ideal op-amps draw small amounts of current through the terminals ($I_{-}$ and $I_{+}$)
- Modelled by placing current sources inside the op-amp

- $I_{BIAS} = \frac{1}{2}(I_{+} + I_{-})$
	- Normally between 0.1pA to 10uA
- $I_{IO} = I_{+} - I_{-}$
