# Coordinates
Let
- $p$ be a vector in $R^n$
- $X = \{x^{1}, x^{2},..., x^{n}\}$ be a complete orthonormal set for $R^n$
	- $X$ is a set of axes in $R^n$, where each element is at right angles to all other elements in the set
- Coordinates of $p$ with respect to $X$ is denoted $[p]^x$
Then
- $p = \sum\limits_{k=1}^{n}[p]^{x}_{k} x^{k}$
	- A vector in $R^n$ is composed by the sum of each axis vector multiplied by the magnitude of the vector w.r.t that axis
- $[p]_{k}^{x} = p \cdot x^{k}$
	- The magnitude of a vector w.r.t an axis vector can be extracted by getting the dot product of a vector and the axis vector (projection of $p$ on $x^k$)
# Coordinate Transformations
Let
- $F = \{f^{1}, f^{2},..., f^{n}\}$ and $M = \{m^{1}, m^{2},..., m^{n}\}$ be coordinate frames in
